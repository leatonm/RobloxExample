# Dad Joke Json.
Here's an example of how you can parse and access the jokes from the JSON file using Lua:

JSON file hosted on GitHub containing dad jokes : https://github.com/mshwery/dad-jokes-api/blob/master/jokes.json
We use the HttpService to retrieve the JSON data from the provided URL. Then, we parse the JSON data using JSONDecode to convert it into a Lua table.
