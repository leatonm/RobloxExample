# Custom player controller.
In this example, we're creating a simple platformer game. The code handles player input for movement (WASD or arrow keys) and jumping (spacebar). The player's character can move in the horizontal direction and jump when grounded.

The script retrieves the player's character and sets up input event handlers to detect key presses and releases. The jump function is responsible for initiating the jump when the player presses the jump key. The move function moves the character based on the input direction. The checkGrounded function checks if the character is touching the ground by performing a raycast downwards.

The script continuously checks if the character is grounded using a while loop with a small delay. This ensures that the character's grounded state is always up to date.

This example demonstrates more advanced concepts like input handling, character movement, and raycasting. You can further expand on this code to create more complex gameplay mechanics, add animations, or implement other features based on your specific requirements or skillset
